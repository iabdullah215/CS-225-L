# Operating System Scheduling Questions

## Question 01
Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times indicated. Each process will run for the amount of time listed. In answering the questions, use non preemptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the information you have at the time the decision must be made.

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| P1      | 0.0          | 8          |
| P2      | 0.4          | 4          |
| P3      | 1.0          | 1          |

a. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the FCFS scheduling algorithm?
b. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the SJF scheduling algorithm?

## Question 02
What advantage is there in having different time-quantum sizes at different levels of a multilevel queueing system?

## Question 03
A CPU scheduling algorithm determines an order for the execution of its scheduled processes. Given n processes to be scheduled on one processor, how many different schedules are possible? Give a formula in terms of n.

## Question 04
Explain the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
