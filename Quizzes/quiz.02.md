# Quiz Description:

> Implement the `Shortest Job First (SJF)` scheduling algorithm in `C/C++` programming language for a simple operating system. Assume that you have a list of processes with their respective burst times (time required to complete execution) stored in an array. Write a `C` function that takes this array of burst times as input and returns the sequence of process execution based on `SJF` scheduling. Also, provide the average waiting time for the processes.
**The burst times are as follows:** `{5, 3, 8, 2, 6}`
Your task is to:
- Write the `C` function to implement `SJF` scheduling.
- Provide the sequence of process execution.
- Calculate the _**average waiting time**_ for the given burst times.

## Solution:

**Code For The `Shortest Job First (SJF)` scheduling algorithm:**

```c++
