## Question Number 01

**Part A**:

> Write a Shell program to arrange the array in bubble sort `array={1,5,12,2,7}`

**Part B**:

> Write a shell program in which you have to create a function `check()` to check which type of file it is which users enters (media file, text file or regular file)

**Part C**:

> Write a bash code in which you have to take two numbers as input from user. Ask for the operation user wants to perform among `+`, `-`,`*`, `/`. Perform the operation and print the result on screen.

## Question Number 02

Consider a scenario where a computer system needs to schedule processes using the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. You are tasked with implementing this algorithm in a programming language of your choice.
Below are the details of the processes and their burst times:
- `Process 1:` Burst Time = 6 units
- `Process 2:` Burst Time = 4 units
- `Process 3:` Burst Time = 8 units
- `Process 4:` Burst Time = 5 units
The time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm is `3` units. Write a program to simulate the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm for the given processes. Your program should calculate and display the turnaround time and waiting time for each process.
Your program should adhere to the following guidelines:
- Implement the Round Robin algorithm to schedule processes.
- Accept input for the number of processes, burst time of each process, and the time quantum.
- Calculate and display the turnaround time and waiting time for each process.
- Ensure that processes are executed in the order they are given.
- If a process has a burst time greater than the time quantum, it should be placed at the end of the queue after executing for the time quantum.
